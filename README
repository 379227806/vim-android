README

This tool sets up Android development for the vim editor. It installs a custom 
script to find an AndroidManifest.xml file. This script sets the java classpath
to the android.jar file. Javacomplete vim script is also installed. Because
there is no GitHub for javacomplete, it has been added to this repo. Two other
vim scripts are installed, Supertab and Snipmate. Both of these have GitHub 
pages. adblogcat enables a preview window in vim with the output of adb logcat.

Requirements:
ctags
vim
python
Android SDK

Install:
chmod +x android-install.sh
./android-install.sh
